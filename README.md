## 💡 **My Philosophy**

> “Security is not a product but a process.” – Bruce Schneier

I believe that security isn’t just about finding vulnerabilities; it’s about fostering a culture that embraces secure practices at every stage. I work towards building resilient, secure systems that support the mission of the teams and organizations I collaborate with.

### 🎯 Fun Fact

Did you know? According to reports, **60% of successful breaches** involve vulnerabilities that are known but have not been patched. This is why I focus so much on **vulnerability management and real-time threat monitoring**.
